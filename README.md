In order to open this game, download the executable .jar file (*puzzle.jar*).
You need to have the latest Java runtime environment installed on your PC.

If you want to open the game on Windows - just double click the file :) 

If you want to open it on an Ubuntu based OS, double click it. If this doesn't work, right click on the file, go to *Properties* -> *Permissions* and select *Allow executing this file as program*.

If you want to run this game on an Arch derivative OS, open your terminal and type java -jar path/to/file in the command line.

The game was designed on Ubuntu, so if you use another operating system, the layout may be a bit off. If that happens, you can manually adjust the frame. Everything else still works correctly.
